# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
# Ecommerce Follow Along Project 
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project** ,this is a hands-on project where we will build a e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB,Express.js, and Node.js).the goal i to learn how to develop a full-stack wed application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1.Understanding the MERN stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for standing application data in a flexible , document based format.
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A framework library for building  User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.
#### 2. REST API Structure
REST API are used to allow communication between the fronted and backend.
we'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding,updating, and retrivingg product data.
-**Order Handling**: managing customer orders.

####3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.


#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.

#### SECTION 2:
> Milestone 2:
- In this i create a react app and design the login page and style it Tailwindcss. It gives a wonderful Experience and i get some knowledge that how to work on a professional project.


## Milestone 3: 
Set up dedicated folders for organising backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. connected the apllication to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server opration.

## Milestone 4:

Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database. Also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.

## ðŸŒŸ  Milestone 5: 
In this milestone, I built the Sign-Up page for user registration using HTML and CSS. I implemented form validation to ensure valid inputs, like email format and password security. This enhances user experience and prevents errors. All changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.  

## ðŸŒŸ Milestone 6 - 
In this milestone, I created a backend signup API that securely stores user data. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before saving to MongoDB. The API ensures secure user authentication and data privacy. All changes are committed and pushed.
