Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project** ,this is a hands-on project where we will build a e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB,Express.js, and Node.js).the goal i to learn how to develop a full-stack wed application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1.Understanding the MERN stack:
**MongoDB :** A database for standing application data in a flexible , document based format.
**Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
**React.js :** A framework library for building  User Interfaces.
**Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.
#### 2. REST API Structure
REST API are used to allow communication between the fronted and backend.
we'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding,updating, and retrivingg product data.
-**Order Handling**: managing customer orders.

####3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.


#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
#### SECTION 2:
Milestone 2:

 - In this i create a react app and design the login page and style it Tailwindcss. It gives a wonderful Experience and i get some knowledge that how to work on a professional project.
